# Spooky  
**Spooky** is a hobby porgraming language, it is supposed to be a somewhat mix of Python and Javascript. Along with that it is an interpreted language.

Speaking of Python, **Spooky** is built off it!

### Syntax

The Syntax of **Spooky** is mostly similar to Python, where a print statement looks like this:
```py
print("Hello World!\n")
```

Defining variables is pretty simple.   
You define a variable by first doing the 'var' keyword , next define the variable name, next comes the equals sign, and then the value.

Here is an example:
```py
age = 16
```
Or this:
```py
name = "Jacob"
```

You can define a comment with a semi-colon, like this:
```
; This is a comment!
```
